# Crasis in Ancient Greek

List of [crases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crasis), i.e. contractions between two words, occurring in Ancient Greek texts.

I think all quite common crases are included. On the other hand, this is not a comprehensive list or a corpus-based survey. The sources are mentioned before the list: LSJ, TLG, Smyth's *Grammar* and several printed grammars.

Corrections and remarks are welcome.
